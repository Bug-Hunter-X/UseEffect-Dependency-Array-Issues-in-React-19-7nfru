# React 19 useEffect Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug related to the useEffect hook in React 19.  The bug involves improperly handling dependencies within the useEffect's dependency array, which can lead to unexpected behavior and subtle errors.  The solution shows how to correctly manage dependencies to ensure the effect runs appropriately.

## Bug Description
The primary issue is an incomplete or incorrect dependency array within the `useEffect` hook.  When the dependency array omits variables that affect the effect's logic, it fails to re-run when it should, causing stale closure values and potentially leading to bugs only apparent under certain conditions.

## How to Reproduce
Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary packages. You can then run `npm start` to start the development server. Observe the console output and inspect the component behavior to see the issue in action. 

## Solution
The provided solution demonstrates how to correctly include necessary variables in the `useEffect` dependency array.  By correctly listing dependencies, you guarantee that the effect executes whenever relevant state changes.
